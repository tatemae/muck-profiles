= MuckProfiles

Add profiles to muck users.  This implements a photo for users as well as a property bag that enables total customization of the user's profile information including privacy settings.

== Installation
Muck profile relies upon the muck-engine and muck-users gems as well as paperclip.  Add the following lines to your environment.rb file:

  config.gem "authlogic"
  config.gem "binarylogic-searchlogic", :lib => 'searchlogic', :source  => 'http://gems.github.com', :version => '~> 2.0.0'
  config.gem "bcrypt-ruby", :lib => "bcrypt"
  config.gem 'thoughtbot-paperclip', :lib => 'paperclip', :source => "http://gems.github.com"
  config.gem 'muck-engine', :lib => 'muck_engine'
  config.gem 'muck-users', :lib => 'muck_users'
  config.gem 'muck-profiles', :lib => 'muck_profiles'

Next run rake gems:install


== Usage
Create a model called profile.rb and add 'acts_as_muck_profile'.  This mixes in the muck profile functionality but also permits further customization of the profile in your application.

  class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_muck_profile
  end

Modify your user model so that it has a profile:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_authentic do |c|
      c.crypto_provider = Authlogic::CryptoProviders::BCrypt
    end
    acts_as_muck_user
    has_muck_profile
  end


Your user model will now appear to have a 'photo' which is delegated to the profile model:

  @user.photo # returns a photo object from paperclip
